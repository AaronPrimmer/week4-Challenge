# 🧠 Timed Quiz — Starter & Bootstrap Versions

Two parallel implementations with clean separation of concerns.  
Your goal: build and customize a **timed 10-question JavaScript quiz** that tracks score, runs a countdown, and displays results at the end.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Create a quiz game that:

- Displays one question at a time from an **array of objects**.
- Allows users to select from 3–4 multiple-choice answers.
- Runs a **60-second countdown timer**.
- Tracks the number of correct answers.
- Ends when all questions are answered **or** the timer reaches 0.
- Displays the final score clearly at the end.

### Example Question Data

```js
var questions = [
  {
    q: "What does DOM stand for?",
    choices: [
      "Data Object Map",
      "Document Object Model",
      "Document Oriented Markup",
    ],
    answer: 1,
  },
  { q: "Strict equality operator?", choices: ["==", "===", "!="], answer: 1 },
];
```

- **Starter** → Minimal HTML & vanilla JS. Blank canvas to focus on logic and DOM manipulation.
- **Bootstrap** → Colorful UI with progress bar, modal, and badges using Bootstrap 5.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Open `starter/index.html` or `bootstrap/index.html` directly in a browser.
2. Only modify files inside `assets/js/` and `assets/css/` to practice **separation of concerns**.
3. Edit the `questions` array in `assets/js/script.js` to include your own quiz content.
4. When finished, deploy your quiz via **GitHub Pages** and submit the URL.

## ✅ Core Requirements

- [ ] Display one question at a time.
- [ ] Each question has 3–4 answer buttons.
- [ ] Add a **60-second timer** that counts down every second.
- [ ] When a user clicks an answer:
  - Check if it’s correct.
  - Update the score.
  - Move to the next question.
- [ ] When time runs out **or** all questions are answered:
  - Stop the timer.
  - Display the final score.
- [ ] Use `setInterval()` for the timer.
- [ ] Use DOM methods like `createElement()`, `appendChild()`, and `textContent`.

---

## 🧩 Stretch Goals (Optional Enhancements)

- **Time penalty:** subtract 5 seconds for incorrect answers.
- **Shuffle:** randomize question or answer order.
- **LocalStorage:** save and display the best score.
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** press A/B/C to answer faster.
- **Accessibility:** focus the first choice on each question; add `aria-live="polite"`.
- **Theme toggle:** add light/dark mode or color themes.
- **Progress bar:** visually show time or question progress.

---

## 💡 Instructor Notes

- The **Starter** version dynamically generates all elements with JavaScript and minimal styling.
- The **Starter with Bootstrap** version demonstrates how to hook logic into a prebuilt UI.
- Encourage students to **customize** both appearance and logic once core functionality works.

## 📦 Submission

Submit your:

1. **GitHub repository URL**
2. **GitHub Pages deployed link**

Make sure both the quiz logic and styling work before submission.
